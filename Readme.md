# 🚀 Docker-Practice

Welcome to my Docker learning journey!  
Over the course of **7 days**, I explored the core concepts of Docker by building hands-on mini-projects and practicing with real-world scenarios.

This repository contains **step-by-step practical exercises** and **useful references** that cover beginner to intermediate Docker concepts – perfect for DevOps learners.

## 📅 Learning Breakdown

| Day | Topic | Key Concepts |
|-----|-------|--------------|
| ✅ Day 1 | Python Calculator | `docker run`, `docker ps`, container basics |
| ✅ Day 2 | Python Flask Project | Containerizing a web app with Flask |
| ✅ Day 3 | Docker Volume | Managing persistent data with `-v` and `--mount` |
| ✅ Day 4 | Docker Networking | Bridge, host, none networks + custom bridge |
| ✅ Day 5 | Docker Swarm | Multi-node swarm setup, `docker service`, scaling |
| ✅ Day 6 | Global Mode & Stack Deployments | Stack YAML files, global mode deployment |
| ✅ Day 7 | Docker Compose | Multi-container orchestration (Node.js, Redis, NGINX) |

## 🧠 Key Topics Covered

- 🔹 Container lifecycle & image management
- 🔹 Volume mounts & data persistence
- 🔹 Network modes: bridge, host, none, overlay
- 🔹 Docker Swarm mode (multi-node orchestration)
- 🔹 Service scaling with replicas
- 🔹 Stack files and global services
- 🔹 Docker Compose for local dev environments
